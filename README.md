# Introduction

This project is focused on the development of an application hotel administrators can use.
Its goal is speeding up, simplifying the work of the receptionist and managing tasks more efficiently.
Basic data operations are possible like adding, saving, updating and deleting.
The app is created on Apache NetBeans IDE and works with SQLite database.

## Overview

The application consists of 9 different frames:
* Authorization window
* Main menu
* Reservations
  * Search
  * Add & Delete
  * Update & Delete
* Clients
* Rooms
* Services
* Discounts

The user enters the application using the expected administrator credentials and then is sent to the main menu.
The main menu contains summarised information about reservations, clients and rooms.
On every individual frame the user can perform operations with the data displayed on the window.
Data is visualised using tables, comboboxes, textboxes and etc.
